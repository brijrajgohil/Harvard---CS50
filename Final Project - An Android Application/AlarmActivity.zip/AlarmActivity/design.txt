This is my CS50 Final Project Implementation

Design.txt

The design's very slick there are four tabs :
a. Set Single Alarm.
b. Set Repeating Alarm.
c. Set Inexact Repeating Alarm.
d. Cancel Repeating Alarm.

The application's very handy to use. It allows you to easily set up and cancel alarm just like alarm clock , just my implementation of it. Lot to come , in google play store.

Thank you for having a look at my application. 
And for the great course.
